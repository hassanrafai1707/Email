## ✨ 📧 Email Service Application: Secure Email Automation

[cite_start]This project is a **robust backend application** developed during an industry internship to provide secure and efficient **email-sending functionality**, seamlessly integrated with database management and a user-friendly interface[cite: 6]. It was engineered over a rigorous 9-week period, focusing on mastering modern Java development frameworks, version control best practices, and core software engineering principles.

### 🚀 Key Features

* [cite_start]**Email Sending:** Implements and configures the **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)** for reliable, automated email delivery within the Spring Boot framework[cite: 30, 36].
* [cite_start]**Data Persistence:** Seamlessly integrates with **PostgreSQL** using the **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)** API to perform comprehensive **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**User Experience (UX) Enhancements:** Features redesigned and optimized **Login and Dashboard pages** for improved usability and clarity[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Entity Mapping & Control:** Utilizes the `@GeneratedValue` annotation effectively for student entity ID generation and ensures accurate entity-to-database mapping[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Feedback Workflows:** Developed clear **confirmation workflows** and dedicated **success pages** to provide users with immediate and positive feedback[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Version Control:** Project history and collaboration were meticulously managed using **Git** as a distributed version control system and **GitHub** for code hosting[cite: 48].

### ⚙️ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up a local development environment for the Email Service Application:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hassanrafai1707/Email.git](https://github.com/hassanrafai1707/Email.git)
    cd Email
    ```
2.  **Database Configuration:**
    * Ensure **PostgreSQL** is installed and running.
    * Create a dedicated database (e.g., `email_db`).
    * Update the database connection details (URL, username, password) in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. [cite_start]This includes the setup and optimization configured during development[cite: 24].
3.  **Run the Application:**
    * Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
    * Run the main Spring Boot application class.

[cite_start]The application server is configured to start on port **8081**[cite: 42].
